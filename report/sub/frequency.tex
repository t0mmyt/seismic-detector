\subsection{Frequency Analysis}
	Another option for analysing the stream was to disregard the amplitudes and concentrate on the frequency domain.  That is to convert to a function of frequency against time.
	
	Many of the frequencies that occur within the streams are considered noise, especially those of a higher frequency that are likely caused by wind.
