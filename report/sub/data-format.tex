\subsection{Raw Data}
	The seismic data is provided in either SAC or Miniseed formats that are can be parsed with the Obspy Python library 
	\citep{obspy}.  Use of this library produces an object containing the raw measurements along with metadata about the station it was produced from.  The library also contains many methods for post-processing operations such as signal filtering and commonly used seismic analysis tools.
	
	In the project, this object is wrapped in to a Data Access Object to add or simplify many of the commonly used operations such as downsampling (for rendering in a browser), time slicing and passing through a bandpass filter to remove high and low frequencies.
