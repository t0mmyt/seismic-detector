\subsection*{Abstract}

	The purpose of the project is to try to develop an infrastructure and tool set for converting raw seismic time series data into a searchable string using SAX (\textbf{S}ymbolic \textbf{A}ggregate appro\textbf{X}imation).  These strings would then be used for event detection and for searching for similarities. An interface will then be developed to enable the searching of observations and events by an end user.  Additionally, it would ideally be able to search for similar patterns over time or between stations relating to an event.
	
\subsection*{Objectives} \label{sec:objectives}
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item To facilitate the importing and storage of raw seismic data and associated meta-data
		\item To calculate and store SAX strings of a whole observation period or an event
		\item To be able to determine the onset of an event in an observation
		\item To provide graphical representations of the analysis
		\item To provide a web based user interface for all of the above
		\item To evaluate the suitability of SAX or SAX-VSM for comparing the patterns of seismic events.
	\end{enumerate}

	\textit{These objectives are slightly altered from the original proposal.  This is discussed in \cref{sec:alteration-objectives}}.
